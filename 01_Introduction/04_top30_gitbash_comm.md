Creating and Using a Git Repository (Fun Example)
This guide walks you through creating a Git repository, cloning it locally, adding a project structure based on a fun movie theme, and pushing your first commit to GitHub.

1. Create a New Repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub and log in.
Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
Give your repository a name, e.g., interstellar-mission.
(Optional) Add a description: Space mission logs and data from the Interstellar crew.
Leave it public or private depending on your preference.
Do not initialize with a README (we'll do it manually).
Click "Create repository".
2. Clone the Repository Locally
Open Git Bash and run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/interstellar-mission.git
cd interstellar-mission
3. Create Folders and Files
Let's simulate a space mission folder structure inspired by the movie Interstellar:

mkdir -p crew_logs/coop
mkdir -p crew_logs/brand
mkdir -p robots/tars
mkdir -p mission_data/gargantua

touch README.md
echo "# Interstellar Mission Logs" > README.md

echo "Cooper's log: Black hole approach imminent..." > crew_logs/coop/log1.txt
echo "Brand's log: Analyzing planet surface..." > crew_logs/brand/log1.txt
echo "TARS diagnostics: 95% operational" > robots/tars/status.txt
echo "Data collected from Gargantua gravity readings." > mission_data/gargantua/blackhole.txt
4. Stage and Commit the Files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Interstellar mission structure"
5. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
